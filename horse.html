                    <h1>Horseheads Brewing, Inc.</h1>
                    <p>The re-branding for a small brewing company called Horseheads Brewing, Inc.. The goal of which was to give the company a more professional and cohesive feel as the previous brand mark was crude and inconsistent, and the bottles had no cohesive feel. The mark was made to emulate a horse with wheat as the mane, and created to be able to be scaled up and down as needed. Multiple touch points were made including business stationary, business cards, and a cohesive design for the bottles.</p>
