                    <h1>in a building</h1>
                    <p><i>in a building</i> was created as a piece in collaboration with the poet Judith Sloan and the White Plains BID (Business Improvement District). The goal of the collaboration was to bring life to vacant storefronts in the city of White Plains through art. Judith Sloan wrote the poem, “in a building” after interviewing residents about their experience of being a resident in the city. The design was made as a response to the overarching friendly and neighborly narratives of the poem. As a way of emphasizing this tone, bubbly, dream-like colors were used as well as bubbly forms. The buildings within the piece are referenced from real buildings in white plains, but placed in peculiar was to accentuate an already dream like quality. The overall goal was to create a piece that was engaging and bright.</p><p>The piece was done in Adobe Illustrator and Adobe Photoshop, with poetry written by Judith Sloan.</p>
